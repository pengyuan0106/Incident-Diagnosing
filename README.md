# Abstract
The Internet-of-Things (IoT) is widely used in many appli-cations such as smart city, transportation, healthcare, and environment monitoring. A key task of IoT maintenance is to analyze the abnormal sensor records and generate incident report. Traditionally, domain experts engage in such labor-intensive tasks. Recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM) have sparked interests in developing AI-based sys-tems to automate these labor intensive processes. However, two critical problems hinder the effective application of LLM in IoTs: (1) LLM lacks background knowledge of de-ployed IoTs; and (2) the incidents are complex events in-volving many sensors and components. LLM needs to un-derstand the sensor relationships for accurate diagnosis. In this study, we propose a Retrieval Augmented language model based Incident Diagnosing and Reporting system (RAIDR) for IoT applications. RAIDR retrieves related sys-tem documents based on the incident features and leverages LLM to analyze anomalies, identify root causes, and auto-matically generate incident reports. The automated incident reporting process streamlines end usersâ€™ decision making for system maintenance and troubleshooting.
